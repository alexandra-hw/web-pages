        nostalgic for the 1990's?</h3></a>
    <p>Pop culture used to define a generation, but it seems the cultural, music and fashion trends of the 1990s have
        been recycled, and what Generation X considered its rite of passage into adulthood, is being discovered and
        claimed by fledgling grown-ups as their own.</p>
    <p>There's been the resurgence of vinyl as the trend-setters' choice of music consumption rather than the ease of a
        digital download, and now the hipsters have discovered the nostalgic sound of a whirring cassette from which to
        enjoy the dulcet tones of everyone from Salt-N-Pepa to Rick Astley.</p>
    <p>Dr Renee Middlemost, a Lecturer in Global Communication and Media in the University of Wollongong's Faculty of
        Law, Humanities and the Arts, says the sense of nostalgia that seems to be gripping Generation Z is influenced,
        paradoxically, by the huge amount of pop culture content with which they are faced.</p>
    <p>"Every generation looks back at past trends," says Dr Middlemost, an expert in pop culture.</p>
    <p>"My background is cult cinema and there has been a lot done around nostalgia in cult cinema and what people
        become nostalgic for, even things that were not around when they were born. It is an interesting thing that is
        happening now and I have seen it in my students who are all into watching shows like Friends.</p>
    <p>"I believe it has something to do with the way people are watching media these days. With platforms like Netflix
        around, people recommend shows to each other, and there are less people seeking out new things. Our tastes seem
        to have narrowed.</p>
    <p>"The whole sharing thing with Netflix and recommendations that has narrowed the tastes of people in regards to
        television viewing has been seen in cult cinema, too. It's all been done by word-of-mouth. And with the sharing
        of videos and content, the online world has made the pop culture loops come around much more quickly than
        before."</p>
    <p>Nineties nostalgia is pervasive in nearly all entertainment- from cinema, to TV, music and fashion, and although
        reminiscing about the good old days is not new, it seems the passion that '90s pop culture elicits is.</p>
