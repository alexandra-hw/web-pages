    <p>The 1960s were a decade of revolution and change in politics, music and society around the world.
        It started in the United States and the United Kingdom, and spread to continental Europe and other parts of the
        globe.</p>
    <p>The 1960s were an era of protest.
        In the civil rights movement blacks and whites protested against the unfair treatment of races. Towards the end
        of the decade more and more Americans protested against the war in Vietnam. Many people in the United States
        thought that Americans had no reason to fight in war that was so far away from
        home.
    </p>
    <p>Female activists demanded more rights for women, whose role in society began to change. The birth control pill
        and other contraceptives were introduced, making it possible for women to plan their careers and have babies
        when they wanted them.</p>
    <p>The 1960s shattered American politics with the assassination of famous leaders. John F. Kennedy, who became the
        first Catholic President in American history, was gunned down in Dallas in 1963. When his brother Robert ran for
        president in 1968 he too was killed by an assassinâ€™s bullet in California. A few months earlier, civil rights
        leader Martin Luther King, who had done more for African Americans than any other person before him, was killed
        in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>
    <p>After World War II people all over the world started working hard and respecting the values they were brought up
        with. Especially in Europe, it was an era of recovery and rebuilding. In the 1960s many young people started
        doubting such values. They protested against society and everything that was mainstream. They had hair long and
        wore unusual and strange clothes.</p>
    <p>Social change was also reflected in the music of the decade. In the 1950s America and the rest of the world
        danced and sang to rock and roll music. A decade later Bob Dylan (Blowing in the Wind), Joan Baez and other
        protest singers composed lyrics that showed what was wrong in society . The Beatles and the Rolling Stones
        started a new era of beat and pop music. In Europe pirate radio stations broadcast from ships in the North
        Sea.</p>
    <p>Television dominated the decade as the most important entertainment medium. By the end of the decade almost all
        homes in America had at least one TV set.</p>
    <p>Towards the end of the 1960s hundreds of thousands of young music fans gathered at Woodstock, New York to
        celebrate the largest pop festival ever held. All of the popular musicians of the time performed there: Jimmy
        Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, Santana, Janis Joplin and others. Many of the young people there called themselves
        hippies. They took drugs, preferably marijuana and LSD, which allowed people to see a colorful, unreal world.
        They believed in sexual freedom and often changed partners at random.</p>
    <p>On the other side of the social scale, many people looked strangely at these protesters. They could not
        understand them and stuck to hard work and family values.</p>
